# So long, and thanks for all the PRs!

Not much to see here, folks! I've left GitHub for less generative pastures!

If you're looking to see which projects I've contributed to recently, you can still find them
[here][gh_repos]. For everything else, you're probably looking for [my personal collection of
repos][gitryu]. You might find some stuff [GitLab][gitlab] or [sourcehut][srht], but I make no
promises!

[gh_repos]: https://github.com/penryu?tab=repositories
[gitlab]: https://gitlab.com/penryu
[gitryu]: https://git.penryu.dev/penryu
[srht]: https://sr.ht/~penryu/
